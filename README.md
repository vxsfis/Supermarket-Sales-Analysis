**Supermarket Sales Analysis**
**Vasilije (Vas) Fisic – July 2025**

This project analyzes supermarket transaction data to identify key trends in customer spending across different product lines, genders, and store branches. Using Excel pivot tables and charts, I explored which product categories generate the most revenue, how spending varies between male and female customers, and which branch outperforms others on average. The goal was to practice fundamental data analysis skills and provide actionable business insights based on real-world data.

Key Findings:

⦁	Home and Lifestyle is the top-performing product line, with the highest average transaction value among all categories.

⦁	Women spend $24.31 more on average per transaction than men at the supermarket.

⦁	Branch C leads in average revenue, outperforming Branches A and B.

These results demonstrate my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize data using Excel, as well as communicate findings that can help managers make better business decisions.
